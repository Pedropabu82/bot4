# bot4

Trading bot sample project using CCXT and XGBoost.

The codebase works with **Python 3.11** and relies on the `ta-lib` Python
package (version `0.6.3`). Make sure you install dependencies from
`requirements.txt` rather than the similarly named `TA-Lib` package which may
lead to import errors.

## Installing the TA-Lib development library

Before installing the Python packages you need the underlying TAâ€‘Lib system
library. On Debian based systems the library can be built with the same steps
used in the CI workflow:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential wget
wget -q http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ta-lib/ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
tar -xzf ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
cd ta-lib
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install
cd ..
```

After this one-time setup you can install the Python bindings via
`pip install -r requirements.txt` as described below.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This installs all required libraries including `xgboost`, `joblib`,
`scikit-learn` and `websockets`.

Additional dependencies used by optional features include `xgboost`,
`scikit-learn`, `joblib` and `websockets`.

## Usage

Edit `config.json` with your API credentials then run. Alternatively set the
`BINANCE_API_KEY` and `BINANCE_API_SECRET` environment variables to avoid
storing keys in the file:

```bash
export BINANCE_API_KEY=your_key
export BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_secret
python main.py
```

Modes available via the `mode` key in `config.json`:

* `live` - run the strategy in real time
* `train` - update the model using logged trades
* `backtest` - replay trades to evaluate performance

### New options

* `min_ai_confidence` - probability threshold (0-1) required by the AI model to allow an entry
* `maker_offset` - fraction added/subtracted from best bid/ask when submitting post-only orders (default `0`)
* Spread and depth are automatically checked before orders to avoid poor fills
* The AI model expects the following features: `ema_short`, `ema_long`, `macd`,
  `macdsignal`, `rsi`, `adx`, `obv`, `atr`, `volume`
## Indicator optimization

Earlier versions shipped with a standalone script called
`optimize_indicators.py` to automatically tune moving averages and RSI
periods. The script was incomplete and has been removed. Adjust indicator
parameters manually in `config.json` if desired.


## Sample data

Example trade logs are stored in the `data/` directory. The repository
includes a small sample file called `data/trade_log_sample.csv`.
When running the scripts you should create `data/trade_log.csv` (you
can copy the sample file) as new entries will be appended there during
execution.

## Logging

All utilities now rely on Python's `logging` module. When running
`main.py` or any of the helper scripts like `auto_retrain.py` or
`fetch_ohlcv.py`, log messages are written to `bot.log` and also
displayed in the console.

The log file now begins with the header `timestamp,symbol,timeframe,type,entry_price,exit_price,pnl_pct,result`.
Backtests require data in this file; if it's empty, the results will also be empty.
